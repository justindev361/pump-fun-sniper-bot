## Introduction

Pump.fun is a decentralized exchange for Solana NFTs and tokens. It is a fast, easy to use and secure NFT and token trading platform. Pump.fun is a platform designed for people to launch, mint and trade new tokens, and it carries a high level of risk. Tokens launched on Pump are instantly tradable, with no delays when minting. While it ensures a fair launch with no pre-sales or insider advantages, the risk is still high. People can dump their coins at any time, and often do.
